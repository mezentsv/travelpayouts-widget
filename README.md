# Travelpayouts Test Task - Widget

This is a test task implementaion for Aviasales(Travelpayouts) Frontend position. The goal is to build a web UI widget that can be embedded into 3rd party website. The task description along with the template can be found üëâ&nbsp; [here](https://github.com/KosyanMedia/Front-end_TP_test).

Two articles by Jenya Y. served as a main reference and guideline. See the walkthoughs for details: üëâ&nbsp; [here](https://blog.jenyay.com/building-javascript-widget/) and üëâ&nbsp; [here](https://blog.jenyay.com/web-ui-widget/)

## Usage

In order to embed the widget on the hosting page:

1Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp; Add the container element/elements that will hold the widget at the desired location and provide `travelpayouts-widget` class:

```html
<div class="travelpayouts-widget"></div>
```

2Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp; Add the following snippet at any location:

```html
<script>
  (function (w, d, s, o, f, js, fjs) {
    w[o] =
      w[o] ||
      function () {
        (w[o].q = w[o].q || []).push(arguments);
      };
    (js = d.createElement(s)), (fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]);
    js.id = o;
    js.src = f;
    js.async = 1;
    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
  })(window, document, 'script', '_tpw', './widget.js');
  _hw('init');
</script>
```

Color and font configurations can be passed to widget like so:

```diff
-_tpw('init');
+_tpw('init', { palette: { primary: { zero: '#ededed' }}});
```

### Examples:

###

- Customized palette:

```diff
-_tpw('init');
+_tpw('init', {
+        palette: {
+          primary: { zero: '#50C9CE', one: '#445E93' },
+          secondary: { zero: '#FCD3DE' },
+          text: { zero: '#445E93' }
+        }
+      });
```

The full list of configurations can be found in `AppConfigurations` interface of `src/models.ts` file.

## Develop

To get started run the following comands in the `Terminal`:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

This will spin up the `webpack-dev-server` and open the default browser with "demo" page that hosts several instances of the widget in different locations.

## Additional Notes

There are a couple of things to keep in mind when developing a widget:

- Widget should not have an impact on the website perfomance that hosts it.
- It should be isolated and not affected by or rely on the website it's being hosted on.
- It should provide the broad browser support
